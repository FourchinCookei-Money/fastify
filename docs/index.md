The documentation for Fastify is split into two categories:

<<<<<<< HEAD

- [Guides](./Guides/index.md)

The reference documenation utilizes a very formal style in an effort to document
Fastify's API and implementation details thoroughly for the developer who
needs such. The guides category utilizes an informal, educational, style as
a means to introduce newcomers to core, and advanced, Fastify concepts.
